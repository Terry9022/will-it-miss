This is the project from the MDN Web Docs article "[Understanding client-side web development tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools)".
>"Client-side tooling can be intimidating, but this series of articles aims to illustrate the purpose of some of the most common client-side tool types, explain the tools you can chain together,
how to install them using package managers, and control them using the command line. We finish up by providing a complete toolchain example showing you how to get productive."
